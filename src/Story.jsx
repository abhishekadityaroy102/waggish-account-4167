<p><p>This is a submission from a mother of An Adventurous Sunny Boy - Suriya Kiran. S alias Mitheleesh – Mithu, who is silently fighting for his life at Private Hospital – Coimbatore.
Kindly shower prayers and blessings as it is the only a miracle that can work at the present moment to bring him back to life.
</p>
<br></br>

Outwardly, he is intact with only a bruise on his frontal forehead but the entire internal – be it his skull, brain, facial bones, lungs, chest have been damaged. Suriya is under observation for 24-48 hours, after which further treatment will be started. He met with an accident on 19th July @ 5.17am head-on collision at Palakkad. This terrible accident has left him with multiple internal fractures to his skull, face, nose, ribs and chest. Suriya’s saving grace from this becoming fatal was that he always wore complete protective riding gear including helmet, gloves, riding jacket with elbow, shoulder and back guards, knee guards and shoes.
<br></br>
If you look into his Instagram Page you will find him concealed with his uncompromised priceless helmet and his first and only love – “Razor-His Himalayan,” which he got out of his own hard earned money during his second year of college, just by doing part-time job and some contribution from his grandfather. He never rides his bike on long drives without a safety jacket or helmet. He won’t give u a lift if you don’t have a helmet and always has safety first in his mind. Anyone who comes in association with him will end up being great fans and bikers.
<br></br>
<p>As a mother, I brought him up with an iron fist, yet I silently cherished him - his discipline, talent, kindness, the goodness in him – also as a good housekeeper and a cook. He earned his Karate Black Belt. An energetic cadet of NCC. I was always mesmerized his power packed dance. A good mimycrist. A versatile actor. Some never knew, as he was passive and never a show off. Always ready for an adventure.

<p>I am prepared to be strong and definitely need your support. We are awaiting for him to regain his consciousness and start responding to the treatment given by the doctors at one of the best Trauma Care Centre – Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore. With your support I know he will emerge out of this.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>The hospital has estimated that an approximate 5-6 lakhs will be needed for Suriya's treatment every week. Given the severity of injuries, they also are unable to estimate the duration of his recovery and treatment at Ganga hospital. Given these circumstances, we are estimating that we will need between 25,00,000-30,00,000 if not more to support his recovery journey including any surgeries that may be needed.
